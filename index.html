    <h2>Why should you even learn this stuff?</h2>
    <p>Well, it's no secret that it is cheaper to build your own machine instead of buying a pre-built one.<br>
    There are also a lot of other benefits other than saving a buck.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality Control: Choose quality components. <em>(Note: Good cooling is often lacking in pre-built PCs!)</em></li>
      <li>Customization: Tailor the specs to fit your needs.</li>
      <li>Upgradability: Easier to upgrade individual components in the future, rather than buying a brand new one.</li>
      <li>Cost-Efficiency: This is where quality control comes in! You can cheap out here and there, without affecting performance.</li>
